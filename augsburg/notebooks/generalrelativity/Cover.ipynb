    "# General relativity using symbolic computer algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of notebooks illustrates the application of symbolic computer algebra in Python to problems of general relativity. It is based on [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) and [GraviPy](https://pypi.org/project/GraviPy/).\n",

    "#### Sign and index convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the convention adopted in the modern literature, in four-dimensional space-time, the index 0 will refer to time while the indices 1 to 3 will refer to spatial coordinates. Unfortunately, in GraviPy, the indices are shifted by 1 because the sign of the coordinate index is used to differentiate between covariant and contravariant coordinates. Therefore, in GraviPy objects, the index 1 will refer to time while the indices 2 to 4 will refer to spatial coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for the Minkowski metric of flat space-time, we adopt the sign convention\n",
    "$$\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "                                   0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
